# Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch

**Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch** is an educational project that implements fundamental ML algorithms from first principles using pure Python and NumPy. This repository is designed for learners who want to understand how machine learning algorithms work under the hood, without relying on high-level libraries like scikit-learn or PyTorch.

⚠️ **Note:** This project is not optimized for production. It is for learning, experimentation, and understanding core ML concepts.

## Who Is This For?

- Students and beginners learning machine learning
- Anyone who wants to understand ML algorithms from scratch
- People preparing for technical interviews
- Learners who want to see explicit math in code

---

## Who Is This Not For?

- Industrial-scale projects
- Large datasets requiring optimized performance
- Production-ready machine learning pipelines

> If you need high-performance or industrial solutions, consider scikit-learn, PyTorch, or TensorFlow.

## Design Philosophy

- All algorithms are implemented from scratch for educational purposes
- Math and logic are kept explicit and readable
- Focus on clarity
- Modular design

---

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome if they:

- Add explanations or improve clarity
- Add new algorithms from scratch
- Keep the educational focus intact

Please avoid adding unnecessary dependencies or abstractions.

## Why This Project Exists

Most ML libraries hide the inner workings of algorithms. This project exists to show exactly how ML algorithms work, helping learners move from “I can run ML” to “I understand ML”.
